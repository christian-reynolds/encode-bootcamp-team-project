# Stock Launch App

This project holds base ERC20 and ERC721 implementations that get used in a seperate <a href="https://github.com/christian-reynolds/encode-bootcamp-team-project-ui">React UI</a> to allow creating and deploying of custom ERC20 & ERC721 contracts based on the users input.

## Deploying to Rinkeby
You will need to add a json file named secret.json.  See the example-secret.json for the exact key names that need to be used.  The Etherscan API key is only needed if you want to verify your contract.
