# Encode Bootcamp Team Project

This project holds a base ERC20 implementation that gets used in a seperate React UI to allow creating and deploying of custom ERC20 contracts based on the users input.

## Deploying to Rinkeby
You will need to add a json file named secret.json.  See the example-secret.json for the exact key names that need to be used.  The Etherscan API key is only needed if you want to verify your contract.
